## Description

This code creates a simple web developer portfolio. 

It conatins five sections:

A header with links to each section as well as a large title with portfolio's author's. 

A two column about me section. One half to display a photo of the author and one half for a concise about me description. The description section has input for a short intro above the content.

A section to display four work examples with one being highlighted above the other three. Use the highlighted section to display a prominent project. There are then three equally sized cards for other work examples that link to the work directly. 

The last section is a two column container with links to contact information or any sites to access the portfolio author. 

## Installation

This code can be used with any application that runs HTML and CSS in a browser.

## Usage

This simple web developer portfolio is for anyone to create a quick bio and showcase their work and projects they've built. It can be used to send to potential employers or partners to easily and quickly display skills in html and css. 

Sections are dynamic with browser sizes. For smaller browsers, sections shrink and stack abover each other.
