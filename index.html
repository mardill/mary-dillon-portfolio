                  <p>
                      I'm a student at UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp learning full-stack development gaining
                      skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript etc. I love web development and building beautiful websites. I've worked as an anaylst
                       helping developers and engineers on the data side at companies such as 
                      The New York Times, Discovery Channel, and Freshly and am now excited to be working
                      as a web developer myself!
